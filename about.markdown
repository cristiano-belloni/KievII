I'm a London based freelance software developer, passionate about building and improving the web.  I mainly use [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) as a platform, though I have a background in J2EE.  You can see some of the code I've written [on github](http://github.com/tomafro), or some of my [contributions to rails here](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/tom-ward/commits).  

If you're interested in hiring me (or want to contact me for any other reason) my email is <a href="mailto:janesconference@bittespring.net">janesconference@bitterspring.net</a>.

This site is built using [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master), the 'blog-aware, static site generator'.  The theme was custom written from the ground up, and date archives and tag pages are generated using a rake task.

Since the 1st June 2009, visitors have spent around {{site.minutes}} minutes reading pages on this site.  That's about {{ site.days }} days.
